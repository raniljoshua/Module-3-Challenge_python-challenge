PyBank problem
----------------------------
Created a Python script for the PyBank problem, that reads in the budget_data.csv file and calculates the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The Python script prints this output to terminal and exports it to the "Financial Analysis.txt" file

PyPoll problem
----------------------------
Created a Python script for the PyPoll problem, that reads in the election_data.csv file and calculates the following:
* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote

The Python script prints this output to terminal and exports it to the "Election Results.txt" file
